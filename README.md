# Levenshtein-distance-algorithm

 The Levenshtein distance (a.k.a edit distance) is a measure of similarity between two strings. It is defined as the minimum number of changes required to convert string a into string b (this is done by inserting, deleting or replacing a character in string a). The smaller the Levenshtein distance, the more similar the strings are. This is a very common problem in the application of Dynamic Programming.
